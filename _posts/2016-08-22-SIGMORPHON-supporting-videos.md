title: Read my poster - SIGMORPHON 2016
---

Earlier this month I was lucky enough to attend ACL where I presented a poster at the co-located [SIGMORPHON Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology and Morphology](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/sigmorphon/). 
I particularly enjoyed re-visiting tiers in phonological representations, learning about phonological networks,
as well as comparing the results of the shared task.
Thank you to the organisers and presenters for an engaging day!

My poster showcased a perceptual experiment I conducted as part of my masters thesis, investigating speech-reading of EMA animations.

Looking at different ways of presenting animations of EMA data,
we concluded that native English speakers could speech-read best
when the animations were presented in a 2D animation format.
Hopefully the insights in the paper can help
future EMA animators when considering how to show the data they collected.

The videos below are some that were shown in the experiment - an adapted animation from Mark Tiede's MVIEW package in Matlab,
Slim Ouni's VisArtico, and an animation package developed during my thesis called [Ematoblender](https://github.com/m2ci-msp/ematoblender).
Ematoblender has since been improved upon with the help of my colleague Alexander Hewer (now it has a much-less zombie-like appearance, a better tongue model and faster processing, meaning a far smoother animation) - the state in this animation is tagged as version  1.0.
