A recent graduate of computational linguistics in the Erasmus Mundus program,
I'm interested in electromagnetic articulography and computer graphics, language learning and phonetics,
and am learning more about NLP and machine learning every day.

Here you'll find some updates about the work I've been doing
at Saarland University and the University of Groningen,
and maybe also some thoughts about writing, technical writing and language.
